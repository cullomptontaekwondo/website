        <h3>About Cullompton TaeKwon-Do</h3>
        <h4>Since 18 June 1987</h4>
        <p>
          Cullompton TaeKwon-Do has been running for over 30 years. Initially it
          was under the instruction of Mr Paul Smith, a 3rd degree black belt of
          the TAGB, and my first instructor. Paul returned back to his 'home' in
          the north of England in 1998 to be with his family, and Mr Daren
          Sainsbury (3rd degree at the time) took over. Daren gained his 4th
          degree soon after, and due to other teaching commitments in 1999, left
          the school in the capable hands of Mr Chris Clarke (2nd degree at the
          time). In 2001 Chris decided to join PUMA (Professional Unification of
          Martial Arts) which was formed on 1st September 2000. Most of his
          students joined PUMA alongside Chris, and some stayed with the TAGB.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next 17 years, with the aid of assisstant instructor Adam
          Appleby, Chris taught over 200 students with 49 of them achieving a
          black belt (Including 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Degree). Chris Clarke retired
          as a 4th degree, from TaeKwon-Do at the end of Sept 2017. And on 1st
          October Adam, also a 4th degree, took over as instructor.

          Adam Appleby started training in March 1996. He graded for 1st degree
          black belt in 1999 with the TAGB in front of a panel of 6th degree
          black belts, headed by Master Michael Dew (Now 8th degree). In 2002 he
          graded with PUMA, again in front of a panel 6th degree black belts
          headed by Master Ray Gayle (Now also 8th degree). He graded for 3rd
          degree in October 2004 and 4th degree in October 2009 under the
          careful scrutiny of Senior Master Ray Gayle, senior Master Jonny Black
          (8th degree), Master Mark Ogborne (7th degree), and Mr Rob Tettmar
          (6th degree). Adam has also trained under Grandmaster Choi Jung Hwa
          (9th degree and the son of the founder of TaeKwon-Do General Choi Hong
          Hi), Grandmaster Kwan Jang Nim Cariati (9th degree and ICTF
          president), Grandmaster Ray O'Neill (9th degree), and First
          Grandmaster Rhee Ki Ha (9th degree and the first grandmaster promoted
          by the the founder, General Choi).
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 2023 after being diagnosed with a health issue, Adam
          reluctantly stopped teaching but a Knight in shining armour, (Shane
          Knight of the TAGB), stepped in to enable Adam's students to continue
          their Taekwon-Do journey. I'm sure they will go from strength to
          strength.

        <h4>My name is Shane Knight...</h4>
        <p>
          ...and I am the senior instructor at the club I joined the club in
          1997 and Mr Daren Sainsbury (5th dan) took over in 1998.
        </p><p>
          Under his guidance I passed my 1st dan grading in 2001 and took over
          as the instructor of the club. I was first introduced to Tae kwon-do
          in the late 80's but it wasn't until 1997 when I moved to Cullompton
          and joined the Cullompton club that I took it more seriously. <p>
            It took 4 years to get my 1st dan and I had some good achievements
            while going up through the gradings, including attending many
            competitions and winning some medals, but more often coming away
            with the knowledge that there is more to learn! I achieved my 2nd
            dan in 2004 and my 3rd dan in 2011, I then went on to making the
            grade of 4th degree black belt (recognised International Instructor)
            in 2015.
          </p><p>
            I have taught many students over the past 15+ years and I would rank
            many of my achievements down to them; watching them pass gradings,
            getting grading awards and going up through the ranks themselves. I
            have felt very privileged to be able to coach on the side lines of
            competitions and watch my students go on to win medals and to know
            there is also still more for them to learn! But I would say the
            thing I am most proud of is how friendly and helpful all the
            students at the Cullompton club have been over the years who have
            come to learn Tae Kwon-do with us.

          <h3>The Tae Kwon-Do Association of Great Britain (TAGB)</h3>
          <p>
            The Tae Kwon-Do Association of Great Britain (TAGB) is a nationally
            recognised Tae Kwon-Do organisation. It was formed in 1983 and has
            since become the founding member of the British Tae Kwon-Do Council
            (BTC) which is recognised by the United Kingdom Sports Council.
            <br /><br />
            TAGB instructors are highly qualified, accredited individuals with many
            years' experience in teaching mixed classes which often include young
            children and disability groups.
            <br /><br />
            Training in Tae Kwon-Do can start at any age. TAGB members start as young
            as five and recently one of our members gained his fifth dan black belt
            on his 70th birthday!

          <p>
            Because of its high-kicking, fast-paced style Tae Kwon Do is a
            thoroughly modern way of getting fit. The TAGB is a great advocate
            of fun and fitness at an early age and TAGB instructors often work
            with local schools to teach self-defence.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the largest martial arts organisation in the world the TAGB has
            over 25,000 accredited members, 600 schools, and organises seminars
            with World Masters, demonstrations, and national, regional and
            international championships every month of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The TAGB is not just concerned with its own development, this is why
            it has played a leading role in the reunification of British Tae
            Kwon-Do into one body. In 1988, the TAGB helped found the British
            Tae Kwon-Do Council (BTC), this being the only governing body of Tae
            Kwon-Do to be recognised by the Sports Council.

          <h3>Tae Kwon-Do International</h3>
          <p>
            The TAGB also helped found Tae Kwon-Do International, the object of
            which is to bring together Tae Kwon-Do practioners throughout the
            World. Tae Kwon-Do International is non-political and it doesn't
            attempt to dictate to member countries how they must run their
            affairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since its foundation in 1993, Tae Kwon-Do International has grown to
            become one of the biggest World Tae Kwon-Do bodies. Its World
            Championships are amongst the largest and best organised and it
            draws its participation from every contingent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tae Kwon Do training is about learning to discipline your mind as
            well as your body and TAGB instructors always include elements in
            their teaching which help their students to develop mentally as well
            as physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            With schools throughout the country the TAGB is the ideal
            organisation for learning a martial art that has evolved through a
            3,000 year history to become the newest Olympic Sport.
