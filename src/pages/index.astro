      <h4>
        My name is Shane Knight and I am the senior instructor at the club
      </h4>
      <p>
        Cullompton Tae Kwon-do was first started in 1987 by Mr Paul Smith (3rd
        dan), I joined the club in 1997 and Mr Daren Sainsbury (5th dan) took
        over in 1998.
      </p><p>
        Under his guidance I passed my 1st dan grading in 2001 and took over as
        the instructor of the club. I was first introduced to Tae kwon-do in the
        late 80's but it wasn't until 1997 when I moved to Cullompton and joined
        the Cullompton club that I took it more seriously. <p>
          It took 4 years to get my 1st dan and I had some good achievements
          while going up through the gradings, including attending many
          competitions and winning some medals, but more often coming away with
          the knowledge that there is more to learn! I achieved my 2nd dan in
          2004 and my 3rd dan in 2011, I then went on to making the grade of 4th
          degree black belt (recognised International Instructor) in 2015.
        </p><p>
          I have taught many students over the past 15+ years and I would rank
          many of my achievements down to them; watching them pass gradings,
          getting grading awards and going up through the ranks themselves. I
          have felt very privileged to be able to coach on the side lines of
          competitions and watch my students go on to win medals and to know
          there is also still more for them to learn! But I would say the thing
          I am most proud of is how friendly and helpful all the students at the
          Cullompton club have been over the years who have come to learn Tae
          Kwon-do with us.
